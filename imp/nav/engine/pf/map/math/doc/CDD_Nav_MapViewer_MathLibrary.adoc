== Introduction
This document describes the math library used in MapViewer.


=== Purpose

* linear algebra data structures and operations
* calculating intersections between various types of bounding volumes
* interpolation of motion
* splines
* geodesy mathematics:  coordinate space conversion  (cartesian, spherical and WGS/NDS)




== Context View

=== Usage of internal Components

==== Linear algebra
* _TVector<T,N>_:  a template vector class which is parameterized by type of scalar and number of components. Commonly used typedefs are Vector3f which is 3 component float vector, Vector2i which is 2 component integer vector.
* _TMatrix3x3<T>_,  _TMatrix4x4<T>_: matrices
* _TQuat<T>_: quaternion

==== Bounding volumes
* _TBoundingBox_: oriented bounding box in cartesian space
* _TAABoundingBox_: axis aligned bounding box in cartesian space
* _SGeoBoundingBox_: a pair of two (longitude; latitude; altitude)  points which  delimit minimums and maximums of a bounding box in NDS space
* _TBoundingRect_: generic bounding rectangle
* _TBoundingSphere_: generic bounding sphere
* _TCircle_: generic bounding circle
* _TFrustum_: frustum of the camera

==== Interpolation of motion
* _CUniformlyAcceleratedMotion_

==== Splines
* _CAkimaSpline_:  Akima spline implementation


==== Geodesy mathematics
* _GeoMath.hpp_:  conversion radians <-> degrees, cartesian <-> NDS, cartesian <-> WGS

==== Misc 3D math
* _Project.hpp_: conversion from OpenGL's screen space to world space and back.



=== Usage of external Components

None except C runtime library.


== Operation Concept

=== Used Algorithms

Bounding volume intersection algorithms, one for each unique pair of bounding volume types.

=== Testability

Very high. All components and algorithms have unit tests.

==== Unit Tests

'//CoC_Navigation/Platform/Nav2010/P004/Development/Default/imp/nav/engine/pf/map/math/test/...' +


=== Further Development

==== Do
* SSE in matrix multiplication
* use 3rd party library such as glm for linear algebra

==== Don't
* Shove unnecessary things to Math.hpp because it is universally included.
